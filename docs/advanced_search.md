# Doing an advanced search of the catalogue (Sign-in required)

</br>

## Step 1. Creating an account

The registration form for creating an account can be accessed from the sign-in screen:
* Click on the “Sign in” button on the home page
* Click “Register now!” at the bottom, left-hand corner of the dialogue box
* Complete all fields and click “SUBMIT”

The new account will be then verified and a confirmation email will be sent to the email account
specified.

NOTE: an institutional email address must be used for registration.

</br>

## Step 2. Doing an advanced search

After signing in, users are able to access the advanced search tool by clicking on 'filter' in the lefthand side menu or clicking on the 'filter' tab at the top righthand corner of the screen.

In order to identify appropriate data or samples, researchers can filter catalogue content by:
* **Study characteristics:** study name (or “acronyms”), study design (eg. case-control, GWAS),
disease, availability of specific participant metadata (smoking, diet, HIV status, blood pressure,
alcohol use)
* **Participant characteristics:** sex, ethnicity, BMI, age, country**
* **Biospecimen characteristics:** sample type (eg. DNA)

** "Country" refers to the origin of the sample, i.e. the participant's country of residence, which may not
coincide with the participant's nationality.

**Note:** _add information describing which filtering characteristics would be available only if the dataset has been added to the archive_

</br>

## Step 3. Exporting search results

Researchers can save their search results by clicking on the page logo at the righthand side of the results box. This will produce an excel spreadsheet with the filtering criteria used as columns.
