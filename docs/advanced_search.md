# Doing an advanced search of the catalogue (Sign-in required)


## Step 1. Creating an account

The registration form for creating an account can be accessed from the sign-in screen:
* Click on the “Sign in” button on the home page
* Click “Register now!” at the bottom, left-hand corner of the dialogue box
* Complete all fields and click “SUBMIT”

The new account will be then verified and a confirmation email will be sent to the email account

## Step 2. Doing an advanced search

After signing in, users are able to access the advanced search tool by clicking on 'filter' in the lefthand side menu or clicking on the 'filter' tab at the top righthand corner of the screen.

In order to identify appropriate data or samples, researchers can filter catalogue content by:
* Study characteristics: study name (or “acronyms”), study design (eg. case-control, GWAS),
disease, availability of specific participant metadata (smoking, diet, HIV status, blood pressure,
alcohol use)
* Participant characteristics: sex, ethnicity, BMI, age, country**
* Biospecimen characteristics: sample type (eg. DNA)

** "Country" refers to the origin of the sample, i.e. the participant's country of residence, which may not
coincide with the participant's nationality.

Researchers can save their search results by clicking on the page log at the righthand side of the results box.

To submit a request, this spreadsheet would need to be submitted, along with a project form (available as a word document). The number of samples required would need to be specified as an added column in the spreadsheet.

Alternatively, the request could be completed by following the process described in the next section
