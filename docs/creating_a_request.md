# Requesting biospecimens or data (Sign-in required)

</br>

Users are able to access the advanced search tool by clicking on 'filter' in the lefthand side menu or clicking on the 'filter' tab at the top righthand corner of the screen.

Researchers can filter catalogue content using a variety of characteristics and save their search results by clicking on the page log at the righthand side of the results box.

To submit a request, this spreadsheet would need to be submitted, along with a project form (available as a word document). The number of samples required would need to be specified as an added column in the spreadsheet.

Alternatively, the request could be completed by following the process described below:

## Step 1. Creating an account

The registration form for creating an account can be accessed from the sign-in screen:
* Click on the “Sign in” button on the home page
* Click “Register now!” at the bottom, left-hand corner of the dialogue box
* Complete all fields and click “SUBMIT”

The new account will be then verified and a confirmation email will be sent to the email account
specified.

NOTE: an institutional email address must be used for registration.

</br>

## Step 2. Adding a project

After signing in, click on the “CREATE PROJECT” button to access the form for adding a project.
NOTE: A number of considerations are relevant when adding a new project. The factors listed below
are documented in the 'New Project' form, which is submitted to the DBAC along with any
request for data/samples.
* Research question being addressed and intended research methods
* Research ethics, consent and study approval
* Benefit to Africa and African collaborators

</br>

## Step 3. Creating a cart

Once a project has been added, a cart can be created within it using the “CREATE CART” button.Step 4. Filtering catalogue content by project requirements
In order to identify appropriate data or samples, researchers can filter catalogue content by:
* Study characteristics: study name (or “acronyms”), study design (eg. case-control, GWAS),
disease, availability of specific participant metadata (smoking, diet, HIV status, blood pressure,
alcohol use)
* Participant characteristics: sex, ethnicity, BMI, age, country**
* Biospecimen characteristics: sample type (eg. DNA)

** "Country" refers to the origin of the sample, i.e. the participant's country of residence, which may not
coincide with the participant's nationality.

## Step 5. Adding relevant data or samples to the cart

Once appropriate data or samples have been identified, they can be added to the cart using the red cart
icon.

After clicking on the cart icon, a dialogue box will appear, which allows the user to specify the number
of samples required.

## Step 6. Reviewing the cart and submitting a request

After data or samples have been added to the cart, its contents can be saved by clicking on the “Save”
button (figure 7). A logo will appear in the top, right-hand corner of the screen, which says “Pending”.

The contents of the cart can be reviewed at any point, by clicking on “ Your Cart” in the menu at the
left of the screen.

Once all of the required items have been added to the cart, the user can submit a request to the DBAC
by clicking the "Request" button (figure 3). The logo at the top, right-hand corner of the screen will
then change to “Requested”.

Once a request has been submitted, it will be reviewed by the DBAC. A response can be expected
within about 4 weeks of submission.
