# Background 

The Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) consortium has generated biospecimens and data for a variety of diseases. Access to these is controlled via a Data and Biospecimen Access Committee (DBAC). For more information on H3Africa and the research projects involved see:
http://h3africa.org.

# How the catalogue functions

The [H3Africa Catalogue](https://catalog.h3africa.org/) gives researchers the ability to browse the available samples and data from
H3Africa studies, along with their descriptions, and request access to these items.
The information contained in the H3Africa catalogue is derived from the H3Africa Archive, which is
hosted by [H3ABioNet](https://h3abionet.org/), and three H3Africa biorepositories (figure 1).
