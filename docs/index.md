# Background 

The Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) consortium has generated biospecimens and data for a variety of diseases. Access to these is controlled via a Data and Biospecimen Access Committee (DBAC). For more information on H3Africa and the research projects involved see:
http://h3africa.org.

</br>

# How the catalogue functions

The [H3Africa Catalogue](https://catalog.h3africa.org/) gives researchers the ability to browse the available samples and data from
H3Africa studies, along with their descriptions, and request access to these items.
The information contained in the H3Africa catalogue is derived from the H3Africa Archive, which is
hosted by [H3ABioNet](https://h3abionet.org/), and three H3Africa biorepositories (figure 1).

# H3Africa archive
The H3Africa archive acts as custodian of H3Africa genomic and phenotype data, and prepares the
data for submission to public repositories such as the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) or
the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA). This a funder requirement, and an important step in
facilitating further research that could benefit study participants.

</br>

# H3Africa biorepositories
Samples from H3Africa studies are deposited into three H3Africa biorepositories, which are based in
Nigeria, Uganda and South Africa:
* [IHVN](http://www.ihvnigeria.org/)
* [IBRH3AU](http://www.ibru.mak.ac.ug/)
* [CLS](http://www.cls.co.za/)

</br>

Metadata from the archive and biorepositories are submitted to the catalogue on a monthly basis. _The metadata available vary by dataset - add information describing which filtering characteristics would be available only if the dataset has been added to the archive._
The H3Africa policies for data and biospecimen access and release are described in the [H3Africa
policy documents](https://h3africa.org/index.php/consortium/consortium-documents/).
