# Browsing the catalogue using the basic search tool (Sign-in not required)

</br>

In order to identify appropriate data or samples, researchers can filter catalogue content by:

* Study characteristics: study name (or “acronyms”), study design (eg. case-control, GWAS),
disease, availability of specific participant metadata (smoking, diet, HIV status, blood pressure,
alcohol use)
* Participant characteristics: sex, ethnicity, BMI, age, country**
* Biospecimen characteristics: sample type (eg. DNA)

** "Country" refers to the origin of the sample, i.e. the participant's country of residence, which may not
coincide with the participant's nationality.
